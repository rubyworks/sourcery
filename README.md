## DESCRIPTION

Sourcery gives you the power to code Ruby at a higher plane of
reality, thanks to the magic of dotRuby and eRuby.


## INSTRUCTION

In your Ruby project add a `src/`  directory, or if you have
a prexisting `lib` directory copy it to `src/` instead (`cp -r lib src`).
From now on only edit the files in `src/`, NEVER edit `lib` files.

After editing `src/` files run:

  $ sourcery

All the `src` files will be rendered and saved to lib.


## INSTALLATION

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install sourcery
